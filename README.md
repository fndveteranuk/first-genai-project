# 🚀 First GenAI Project

This is my first GPT-4–powered Python app using the OpenAI API — built as part of my Generative AI Consultant portfolio.

---

## 💡 What It Does

This script sends a prompt to GPT-4 using secure `.env` key handling and prints the AI’s response to the terminal.

---

## 🔎 Why It Matters

It’s a **secure, modular, and deploy-ready** base for building GenAI tools — the kind I’ll use for:

- 🧠 Automating knowledge workflows
- 👥 Supporting veterans and inclusive services
- 🧰 Experimenting with GenAI pipelines (LangChain, n8n, Vertex AI)

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- `Python 3.13`
- `OpenAI API` (v1 client)
- `python-dotenv` (for key management)
- `PyCharm` (IDE)
- `Git + GitHub` (version control)

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Add a CLI interface
- [ ] Dockerize the app
- [ ] Convert to a LangChain RAG module
- [ ] Publish on HuggingFace or Replicate

## 🧭 Mission Alignment

This is part of [FNDVeteran.UK](https://fndveteran.uk) — an AI-first advocacy project using GenAI to promote digital inclusion for disabled veterans.

## 📜 License

MIT — free to use, adapt, and share. Just don’t expose your `.env` like I nearly did. 😅
